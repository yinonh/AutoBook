## Description

AutoBook is a web system for management and day-to-day operation of a library, mainly adapted during the corona period.

The users can see all the library catalog, get suggestions about books thay might like, write review and rank them, order and return them, see upcoming library events for student and sign up to them and more and all of that without risking themselves by gathering.

The system is especially accessible to adults and students:

>For adults: there is an easy mode for taking and returning books only, there is a search on the site, personal area where you can see all the borrowed and favorite books and more..

>For students: there is an option to register for upcoming library events, there is a student forum, student activities, tutor Board and more...

System management and database changes are all managed by the librarian without the need for external intervention
